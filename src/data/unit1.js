      notes: `
The chain of custody (CoC) is the chronological and documented record of:

• seizure
• control
• transfer
• analysis
• disposition

of physical and digital evidence.

It establishes that the evidence presented in court is:
• authentic
• unaltered
• uncontaminated
• continuously accounted for

In drone forensics, chain of custody is especially complex because investigations may involve:
• multiple drone components
• onboard memory
• cloud evidence
• mobile devices
• cross-jurisdiction investigations

A broken chain of custody creates a legal presumption that evidence could have been compromised.

Accountability:
Every individual handling evidence becomes responsible for its condition during custody.

Authenticity:
Evidence must be provably genuine through:
• exhibit numbers
• tamper seals
• cryptographic hashes
• photographs

Admissibility:
Courts require chain of custody documentation before evidence can be accepted legally.

    {
      heading: "Overview of Cloud Forensics in UAV Systems",

      notes: `
Cloud forensics in UAV investigations refers to the:
• identification
• preservation
• extraction

of evidence stored on remote servers operated by:
• drone manufacturers
• enterprise fleet platforms
• third-party services

When onboard storage is:
• wiped
• encrypted
• destroyed

cloud records frequently provide an independent evidence trail.

Unlike onboard storage, cloud evidence exists outside the operator's direct control once uploaded, making it resilient against many anti-forensic techniques.
`,
    },

    {
      heading: "Why Cloud Evidence Matters",

      notes: `
Modern drones such as:
• DJI
• Skydio
• Autel
• Parrot

automatically synchronize flight records whenever the paired device connects to the internet.

Cloud evidence is important because:

• cloud records survive even if the drone is destroyed
• timestamps are server-side and resistant to clock manipulation
• cloud systems may store hidden operational data unknown to the operator

Examples include:
• device pairing history
• geofence unlock requests
• account activity
• synchronization logs
`,
    },

    {
      heading: "Flight Records Stored in the Cloud",

      notes: `
Cloud flight records may contain:
